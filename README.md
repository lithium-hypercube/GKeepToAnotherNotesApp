# GKeepToAnotherNotesApp
This is a script to convert a Google Keep notes archive generated by google's takeout function to Another Notes App compatible format  
You can find Another Notes App here: https://github.com/maltaisn/another-notes-app

I only tested it with text notes and do not know how it will interpret checklists, drawings, voice recordings etc. If it crashes try to move the file it was on to a different directory, rerun the script, and then manually add the note in the app.

Steps to use :

-     export your google keep notes with takeout
-     unzip the downloaded archive
-     cd to the Keep folder
- 	  download GKeepToNotes.py to the folder you are in
-     from this folder run
-     python3 GKeepToNotes.py *.json
-     import ./res/notes_converted.json (I used adb to transfer the file) in notes and hope it works
